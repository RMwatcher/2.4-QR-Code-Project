Here is a simple QR code generator using the inquirer, qr-image and fs packages from npm.

You use node index.js to run the js file using node to prompt the user to enter a url and once the user press enter, the file will generate a qr code as well as save the url on a seperate txt file.

This js file doesn't add qr code or url onto the txt file or the qr code itself. It'll override the qr code as well as the txt file everytime a user runs this file and enters a url.
